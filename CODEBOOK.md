# Getting and Cleaning data - Final Course Project
***

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

## Problem statement

Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Dataset classification and description

1. The run_analysis.R script makes use of data present in x_train.txt, x_test.txt, y_train.txt, y_test.txt, subject_train.txt and subject_test.txt, they can all be found inside the downloaded dataset, namely URI HAR Dataset.

2. The features.txt contains the correct variable name, which corresponds to each column of x_train.txt, x_test.txt, y_train.txt, y_test.txt. Further feature mapping is stated features_info.txt.

3. The activity_labels.txt contains the desciptive names for each activity label.
The descriptions of these activity labels need to be modified as a part of the script

4. The README.txt is the overall desciption about the overall process of how publishers of this dataset did the experiment and got the data result.
